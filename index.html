AcademEase does not collect or store any data from the user except for the storing of attendance, timetable and notes locally on the device. The PDF scanner utilises the device camera, but all the processing happens locally on-device, and the app does not have access to the internet. If you choose to use the feature for the extraction of timetable from an image, your image will be uploaded to Google's servers and your image will be handled according to Gemini's privacy policies.
