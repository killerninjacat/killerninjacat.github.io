BudgetEase is a completely offline app with no access to the internet, and if you choose to use the app, all of your data related to the app is only stored locally on your device in which the app is installed.
The notification permission is required to achieve the core functionality of the app - automatically keeping track expense notifications. Since this may involve processing sensitive data, BudgetEase is built such that it can never connect to the internet.
